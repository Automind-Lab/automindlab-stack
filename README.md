# AutoMindLab Stack

AutoMindLab Stack is the enterprise runtime, host/agent system, and integration layer for business-facing OpenClaw deployments.

BMO-stack is a reference point only.
AutoMindLab owns its own council, specialist agents, automation, and runtime-side service surfaces.

## What this repository owns

- the Council of 13 enterprise council
- specialist agents such as Pump Specialist
- the OpenClaw host / worker split for AutoMindLab
- deployment and operations scaffolding
- GitHub automation for validation and repository health
- reusable service clients for consumer products

## Boundary model

### AutoMindLab Stack owns
- runtime and agent execution
- council and specialist routing
- enterprise-side APIs and operational hardening
- deployment documentation and host setup

### Consumer applications own
- user experience
- business records and persistence
- approvals, reporting, and workflow outcomes

### BMO-stack is
- an architectural reference point
- not the owner of this production council
- not the home of the AutoMindLab enterprise runtime

## Current implementation

### Council of 13
The enterprise council is made of 13 original operating profiles inspired by:
Nikola Tesla, Ram Dass, Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, Bob Ross, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Napoleon Bonaparte, Elon Musk, Carl Jung, Marcus Aurelius, Robert Cialdini, and David Goggins.

### OpenClaw host / worker topology
The intended topology is:
- `automind-host` = host-facing conversational runtime, sandbox off
- `automind-worker` = dedicated sandbox worker, sandbox all

### FLOWCOMMANDER diagnostic consultation
This repository packages the AutoMindLab-side diagnostic consultation surface for FLOWCOMMANDER and similar products.

## GitHub automation
The repository includes:
- CI validation for council and diagnostic-service scaffolding
- scheduled repository health checks
- CodeQL analysis for JavaScript files
- Dependabot updates for GitHub Actions and npm dependencies

## Design rules

- runtime-side output is advisory unless a consumer product explicitly persists it
- safety, escalation, and uncertainty should always be explicit
- specialist guidance should stay structured and reviewable
- host and worker responsibilities should remain separate
